# Introduction
The article discusses the global burden of bacterial infections and highlights the lack of comprehensive estimates covering all locations and major infectious syndromes, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The authors present the first global estimates of deaths associated with 33 clinically significant bacterial pathogens, both susceptible and resistant to antimicrobials, across 11 infectious syndromes in 2019. They used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study and the Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance 2019 study to estimate global, regional, and national mortality and years of life lost associated with these 33 bacterial pathogens across 204 countries and territories and 286 underlying causes of death, by age and sex, in 2019. The authors emphasize the importance of reducing the number of deaths due to infections to achieve health equity and the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all.


## Literature Review

In this study, we estimated the fatal burden associated with infection caused by 33 bacterial species or genera across 11 infectious syndromes using methods and data from the GBD 2019 and Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance studies.3, 19 Detailed methods have been published elsewhere.19 Briefly, using 343 million individual records or isolates covering 11 361 study-location-years, we implemented three modelling steps to estimate the number of deaths associated with each bacterial pathogen across 204 countries and territories for 2019. First, we estimated the overall number of deaths in which infection had a role using methods described in the Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance study.19 Second, we determined the infectious syndrome responsible for each death due to an infection. Finally, for each infectious syndrome we estimated the distribution of pathogens responsible. With the use of these components, we estimated the number of deaths associated with each of the 33 bacterial pathogens of interest in this study. A summarising flowchart and detailed approach description for each step of the estimation process are in appendix 1 (section 10). All estimates were produced by age, for males and females, and for 204 countries and territories.

We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines21 throughout the study (detailed in appendix 1 [section 7]). This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations.22 The complete GATHER checklist is provided in appendix 1 (section 8).

Input data
We used a subset of the input data described in the Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance study to estimate mortality burden by pathogen.19 We selected data inputs only if they were based on a representative sampling framework that would not bias the aetiology estimation towards a specific pathogen (eg, we did not deliberately sample 100 cases of every pathogen). The input data source types that met these criteria were: multiple-cause-of-death and vital registration data; hospital discharge data; linkage data sources; mortality surveillance in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) study; literature reviews of the microbial cause of meningitis, neonatal sepsis, lower respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections, peritonitis, and bone and joint infections; and laboratory-based passive surveillance data. We used multiple-cause-of-death and vital registration data, hospital discharge data, CHAMPS, and linkage data sources to estimate the number of deaths for which infection had a role and the distribution of infectious syndromes (appendix 1 [section 4]). We used data from CHAMPS, literature reviews, and laboratory-based passive surveillance systems to estimate the pathogen distribution for each infectious syndrome (appendix 1 [section 6]). The number of individual records or isolates used in each step for each of the GBD regions is shown in appendix 1 (p 62).

Deaths in which infection played a role
Detailed methods on how the number of deaths in which infection played a role were estimated have been published previously.4 Briefly, we estimated the number of deaths for which either the underlying cause of death was infectious (using GBD 2019 estimates) or for which a contributing factor in the death was sepsis and the underlying cause was non-infectious. For the identification of sepsis in non-infectious underlying causes of death, we used the following data inputs: 121 million cause-of-death records with multiple-cause-of-death data from eight countries and territories; 192 million hospital records with patient discharge status from seven countries and territories; 264 000 multiple-cause-of-death records linked to hospital records from ten countries and territories; and 849 deaths from CHAMPS sites across six countries. We developed a random-effects logistic regression model to predict the fraction of deaths involving sepsis for each underlying cause of death, age, sex, and geographical location using methods described previously.4, 19 Using this cause-fraction, we estimated the number of deaths for which the underlying cause was non-infectious and sepsis occurred. We then added this to the number of deaths in which the underlying cause was infectious from GBD 2019 to estimate the number of deaths in which infection had a role.

Infectious syndrome estimates
Detailed methods on the estimation process for infectious syndromes have been published previously19 and are in appendix 1 (section 4). Briefly, we used the available data described in the Input data section (multiple cause of death, hospital data with patient discharge status, linkage data, and CHAMPS) to determine the infectious syndrome responsible for sepsis by underlying cause, age, sex, and geographical location. Within our modelling framework, an infectious syndrome is the infection directly responsible for sepsis and serves as the bridge between the underlying cause of death and sepsis. We estimated 11 infectious syndromes: meningitis and other bacterial CNS infections; cardiac infections; peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections; lower respiratory infections and all related infections in the thorax; bacterial infections of the skin and subcutaneous systems; infections of bones, joints, and related organs; typhoid, paratyphoid, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella; diarrhoea; urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis; bloodstream infections; and gonorrhoea and chlamydia. We then used syndrome-and-age-specific mixed effects logistic regression models (using sex, Healthcare Access and Quality Index, and syndrome-specific bias covariates and a nested random effect on underlying cause) to estimate the fraction of sepsis-related deaths that were caused by each infectious syndrome for each underlying cause of death, age, sex, and geographical location. Applying this fraction to the estimate of number of infection-related deaths from the previous step, we determined the number of deaths that occurred due to a given infectious syndrome by underlying cause of death, age, sex, and geographical location. We estimated deaths with an infectious syndrome as the sum of deaths with the syndrome as an underlying cause of death (ie, for those syndromes considered to be underlying causes) plus deaths with a non-infectious underlying cause where the syndrome was estimated to occur (eg, all deaths where the underlying cause was meningitis plus all road traffic injury deaths in which meningitis occurred). Bloodstream infections; infections of bones, joints, and related organs; and peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections are not estimated in GBD, so for these three infectious syndromes, we assumed they had a non-infectious underlying cause to estimate deaths.

Pathogen distribution
Detailed methods on the estimation process for pathogen distribution have been published previously19 and are in appendix 1 (sections 5 and 6), including exceptions and special handling decisions. Briefly, we used data from 343 million isolates covering 11 361 study-location-years to estimate pathogen distributions for each infectious syndrome that varied by age and location, with a subset of this data adapted to calculate pathogen-specific and syndrome-specific case-fatality ratios (CFRs). We selected a set of pathogens to be explicitly estimated as part of the cause of each infectious syndrome. This selection was based on several factors. First, selection was influenced by the prevalence of each pathogen in the raw data, because the amount of available data restricts the number of pathogens that can be estimated successfully. Second, we aimed to produce estimates for the combination of pathogens that, collectively, represented at least 85% of the aetiological causes of a given infectious syndrome. We included three residual categories: (1) other bacteria and (2) polymicrobial—for bacteria that did not meet these criteria or had two or more bacteria isolated from a single isolate—and (3) non-bacterial pathogen, for pathogens that were not bacteria (ie, viruses, fungi, or parasites).

Much of the input data on pathogen distribution were only reported on a subset of pathogens, such that they did not have a complete denominator for all possible pathogens. For example, many surveillance systems for meningitis only monitor S pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis as the causative pathogen. To account for this partial distribution, we used a network meta-analysis, which allowed us to include any dataset reporting on two or more pathogens. We implemented this network meta-analysis using the multinomial estimation with partial and composite observations (MEPCO) modelling environment. This approach allowed us to include covariates in the network analysis, incorporate Bayesian priors (ie, prior probability distributions), and use data that compared one pathogen with all other pathogens. Input data for the MEPCO process consisted of ratios of sums of cases within a study (with each sum representing a specific pathogen or combination of pathogens). The model was fit by minimising the sum of the residuals between log-transformed observed ratios and predictions using a non-linear likelihood minimisation problem optimised using the Gauss-Newton method23 (appendix 1 [section 6.3.1]). The resultant MEPCO estimate was the non-fatal pathogen distribution for each infectious syndrome.

To estimate the fatal pathogen distribution, we calculated syndrome-specific and pathogen-specific CFRs using data that linked pathogen-specific disease incidence to deaths and the meta-regression–Bayesian regularised, trimmed (MR-BRT) tool. We estimated CFRs as a function of age, Healthcare Access and Quality Index, and various bias covariates that were specific to the nuances of the data for each infectious syndrome (appendix 1 [section 5]). We then used the pathogen-specific and syndrome-specific CFRs to produce a pathogen distribution of number of deaths estimated for each infectious syndrome by age and location. Our modelling framework accounted for both data-rich and data-sparse pathogens (appendix 1 [section 5.3]). In this analysis we do not report estimates for Mycobacterium tuberculosis because this specific pathogen is already part of a global strategy with well delineated surveillance and data-driven control plans, and the motivation for the current study was to provide insight into the public health burden of less well studied pathogens.

Estimating mortality and YLLs
To estimate the number of deaths due to the pathogens of interest, we multiplied the number of deaths for each underlying cause, age, sex, and location by the fraction of deaths in which infection had a role, the fatal infectious syndrome fraction, and the pathogen fraction, and summed across all underlying causes of death and infectious syndromes to estimate the number of deaths due to a given pathogen by age, sex, and location. We estimated YLLs associated with each pathogen using previously published methods3 that convert age-specific deaths into YLLs using the standard counterfactual life expectancy at each age.

Uncertainty and validity analysis
Following standard GBD methods,16 we propagated uncertainty from each step of the analysis into the final estimates of deaths associated with each pathogen by taking the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each quantity of interest. To assess model validity, we calculated the root mean square error and coefficient of determination (R2) for each pathogen distribution model in proportion space for both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions (appendix 1 [section 6.5]).

Results
In 2019, there were an estimated 13·7 million (95% UI 10·9–17·1) infection-related deaths globally, with 7·7 million (5·7–10·2) deaths associated with the 33 bacterial pathogens we investigated. These bacteria altogether were associated with 13·6% (10·2–18·1) of all global deaths in 2019 and 56·2% (52·1–60·1) of all infection-related deaths for that year. The all-age mortality rate was 99·6 deaths (74·2–132) per 100 000 population collectively for these pathogens. Only one organism, Staphylococcus aureus, was associated with more than 1 million deaths in 2019 (1 105 000 deaths [816 000–1 470 000]; table). Four additional pathogens were associated with more than 500 000 deaths each in 2019; these were Escherichia coli, S pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (table, figure 1A). These five leading pathogens were associated with 30·9% (28·6–33·1) of all infection-related deaths and were responsible for 54·9% (52·9–56·9) of all deaths among the investigated bacterial pathogens. Of the bacteria estimated, Morganella spp, Providencia spp, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae had the fewest associated deaths (table). There were 304 million (234–392) YLLs associated with the 33 bacterial pathogens globally in 2019, representing 18·1% (14·1–22·8) of the global YLLs for the year.  Please summarize
